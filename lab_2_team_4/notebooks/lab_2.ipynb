    "\n",
    "The American National Election Studies (ANES) conducts surveys of voters in the United States.  While its flagship survey occurs every four years at the time of each presidential election, ANES also conducts pilot studies midway between these elections.  You are provided with data from the 2018 ANES Pilot Study.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a glimpse into some of the intricacies that go into the design of this study, take a look at the introduction to the [ANES User's Guide and Codebook](https://electionstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/anes_pilot_2018_userguidecodebook.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to consider the way that the ANES sample was created.  Survery participants are taken from the YouGov panel, which is an online system in which users earn rewards for completing questionnaires.  This feature limits the extent to which results generalize to the U.S. population.\n",
    "\n",
    "To partially account for differences between the YouGov panel and the U.S. Population, ANES assigns a survey weight to each observation.  This weight estimates the degree to which a citizen with certain observed characteristics is over- or under-represented in the sample.  For the purposes of this assignment, however, you are not asked to use the survey weights.  (For groups with a strong interest in survey analysis, we recommend that you read about R's [survey package](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/).  We will assign a very small number of bonus points (up to 3) to any group that correctly applies the survey weights and includes a clear explanation of how these work)."

    "\n",
    "You will use the ANES dataset to address five research questions.  For each question, you will need to operationalize the concepts (selecting appropriate variables and possibly transforming them), conduct exploratory analysis, deal with non-response and other special codes, perform sanity checks, select an appropriate hypothesis test, conduct the test, and interpret your results.  When selecting a hypothesis test, you may choose from the tests covered in the async videos and readings.  These include both paired and unpaired t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and sign test.  You may select a one-tailed or two-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please organize your response according to the prompts in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a group lab.  There is a **maximum of three students per team.**\n",
    "Although you may work on your own, we do not recommend this (we have found that individuals tend to do worse than teams on past labs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please limit your submission to 4500 words, not counting code or figures.  We will use some python code like the following to perform the wordcount on your notebook or Rmd file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import nbformat\n",

    "**Hint:** When answering questions about the potential gaps between conceptual and operational definitions it is often helpful to ask yourself \"If I could do anything I wanted, including borrowing Rick's portal gun, or doing an FMRI scan on all survey takers, to operationalize this particular concept how would I do it\" and then explain how that is different than what is actually measured.
